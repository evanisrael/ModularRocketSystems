manufacturer = Modular Rocket Systems
description = What does quantum mechanics have to do with RCS thruster blocks? Absolutely nothing! Gauranteed to contain no quantum components.These RCS thrusters are angled to allow use on the diagonal "corner" positions of your vehicle, and still thrust efficiently in the direction you are steering.
