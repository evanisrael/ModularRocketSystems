Modular Rocket Systems - Part Pack

by Ed T. Toton III, aka NecroBones.


Installation:

Simply copy the "ModRocketSys" folder into your GameData folder. If upgrading from a 
previous version, be sure to delete the old one from GameData first (this is the cleanest
option).


Information:

This parts pack is intended to be a supplement to the stock game parts, filling in a 
few gaps left by the base game. Most of the parts are direct analogs to existing parts,
or are a combination thereof. For instance, several of the fuel tanks share exactly the
same stats (size, mass, cost, etc) as an existing tank, but merely provides an alternate
appearance. Others combine the capabilities of several other parts, and therefore will
have a similar "mass cost" as using the parts individually.

The point is to give new cosmetic choices and a little more flexiblity in designing 
your rockets, and a slightly more NASA-like appearance along the way. The parts are
meant to be tastefully simple, withou racking up massive amounts of polygons or taxing
your CPU more than stock parts should. 

We hope you enjoy this pack. If you have any comments or feedback, please feel free to
send a private message to NecroBones on the KSP forums. Thanks!
